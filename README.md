## Syllabus

- Learn about the core abstractions and unique building blocks of the Haystack framework and see how these elements can be combined for various AI use cases.
- Build a RAG pipeline by using Haystack components, pipelines, and document stores.
- Create custom components in your pipeline by building a Hacker News summarizer that extends your app’s ability to access APIs.
- Use conditional routing to create a branching pipeline with a fall back to web-search when the LLM does not have the context needed to fully respond to the user’s query.
- Build a self-reflecting agent for named entity recognition with a Haystack pipeline that is able to loop using an output validator custom component.
- Create a chat agent using OpenAI’s function-calling capabilities which allow you to provide Haystack pipelines as tools to the LLM, enhancing that agent’s capabilities.
